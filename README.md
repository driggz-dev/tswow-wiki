# TSWoW Wiki

Welcome to the Wiki for TSWoW, hosted as a GitHub repository. Via pull-requests, **anyone** is welcome to contribute to this wiki. We currently have to manually review all edits, but in the future we will set this up so the process is automatic for most edits.

## Guidelines

- Documents should be written as markdown (.md) files and placed in the appropriate directory.

- The root of each subdirectory should contain a README.md that explains what content should go in that folder.

- For now, we keep images in the folder that use them but we should probably change this if the wiki becomes larger.

- Try to keep directory hierarchies as shallow as possible.

- Just try to use common sense and keep documents similar in style.

- Be aware that by pushing to this repository, you agree to release  all content under the [GNU General Public License, version 3](LICENSE).
