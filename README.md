# TSWoW Wiki

Welcome to the Wiki for TSWoW, hosted as a GitHub repository. Via pull-requests, **anyone** is welcome to contribute to this wiki. We currently have to manually review all edits, but in the future we will set this up so the process is automatic.

[Watch this guide for how to edit this Wiki]()

## Sections

- [Documentation](Documentation/README.md)
- [Introduction](Introduction/README.md)
- [Tutorials](Tutorials/README.md)


## Guidelines

- Documents should be written as markdown (.md) files and placed in the appropriate directory.

- The root of each subdirectory should contain a README.md that explains what content should go in that folder.

- For now, we keep images in the folder that use them but we should probably change this if the wiki becomes larger.

- Just try to use common sense and keep documents similar in style.

- Be aware that by pushing to this repository, you agree to release  all content under the [GNU General Public License, version 3](LICENSE).
