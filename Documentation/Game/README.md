# Game

This section is for documenting the 3.3.5 version of World of Warcraft itself. This section should not contain overly technical documentation that's irrelevant for TSWoW, for that you should use any of the following: 

- [The TSWoW codebase](https://github.com/tswow/tswow/) - For documenting individual DBC/SQL files (code comments)
- [The TSWoW Standard Library](https://github.com/tswow/tswow-stdlib) - For documenting how the stdlib classes works (code comments)
- [wowdev wiki](https://wowdev.wiki/Main_Page) - For the WoW client
- [TrinityCore.info](https://trinitycore.info/) - For the TrinityCore server emulator
