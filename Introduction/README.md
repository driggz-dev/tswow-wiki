# Modding Introduction

This section aims to explain the basic concepts of TSWoW modding and help new users get started writing their own mods. 

- These tutorials are intended for complete beginners to WoW modding, and should cover the topics necessary to get started. If they don't, [please let us know!](https://github.com/tswow/tswow/issues)

- These tutorials are designed to be read **in order**. While you might not be interested in every aspect of WoW modding, learning about them will help you better understand the greater picture. TSWoW modding is **much** simpler than modding used to be, so working through these examples should not take very long.

- It is expected that you might not understand all the code you write right away. You are still advised to **not** copy-paste the code from the examples, but to type it out yourself and try to see how auto-completion helps you find the properties and functions you are looking for.
